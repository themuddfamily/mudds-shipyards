# Review candidates

Previously identified candidates were reproduced and addressed in the current branch:

- `scripts/combat/live_combat_authority.gd`: receipt allocation now uses a monotonic
  64-bit session allocator for deferred presentations, with explicit fail-closed
  saturation behavior.
- `scripts/audio/station_machinery_ambience.gd` and
  `scripts/audio/combat_audio_presentation.gd`: playback acceptance now includes an
  explicit backend-aware seam and atomic detach-on-rejection behavior.
- `scripts/game/game_flow.gd`, `scripts/effects/hero_damage_presentation.gd`,
  and `scripts/world/shipyard_world.gd`: whole-Main teardown now clears owner-side
  deferred presentation queues to prevent stale replay after re-entry.

There are currently no open review candidates in this file.
